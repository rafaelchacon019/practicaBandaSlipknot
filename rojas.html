    <h2>Slipknot all hope is gone</h2>
    <h4>Letra</h4>
    <l>The state of the nation â€“ violation
        A broken promise is as good as a lie
        The hell is humongous, the Devil's among us
        And we will burn 'cause we won't unite
        What are we conceding for our freedom?
        Why does anybody think we need 'em?
        I would rather fight than let another die
        We're the problem, but we're also the solution
        All hope is gone
        If you want it, come and take it from me
        If you think you can, you still don't know me
        Let me tell you, man, I said it, I meant it
        And I will always have the right to defend it
        50 seconds, 100 murders
        The bill of rights is a bill of sale
        What will you do when the war is over?
        What will you do when your system fails?
        We have made the present obsolete
        What do you want? What do you need?
        We'll find a way when all hope is gone
        We've seen the fall of the elite
        Bury your life, take your disease
        We'll end the world when all hope is gone
        We have made the present obsolete
        What do you want? What do you need?
        We'll find a way when all hope is gone
        We've seen the fall of the elite
        Bury your life, take your disease
        We'll end the world when all hope is gone
        The wretched are the wounded, the hungry starve to death
        In a place where no one goes, the air itself is a final breath
        So discontinue the antiseptic care charade
        As a cry of justice comes, a malignant fire fades
        I am the reason your future suffers
        I am the hatred you won't embrace
        I am the worm of a pure gestation
        I am the remedy, spit in my face
        All your laws and rules are outdated
        All your subjects are killing the kings
        I could rattle off a million other reasons why
        But does it matter when the only thing we love will die?
        We have made the present obsolete
        What do you want? What do you need?
        We'll find a way when all hope is gone
        We've seen the fall of the elite
        Bury your life, take your disease
        We'll end the world when all hope is gone
        We've made the present obsolete
        What do you want? What do you need?
        We'll find a way when all hope is gone
        We've seen the fall of the elite
        Bury your life, take your disease
        We'll end the world when all hope is gone
        When all hope is gone
        When all hope is gone
        When all hope is gone
        </l>
